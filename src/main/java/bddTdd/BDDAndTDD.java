public class BDDAndTDD {
//extension of TDD .. in the past the developer make unit failing test before development then make test pass
// in BDD .. test first also but BDD test are wrotten in plain descriptive english
// tests are explained as behavior of apps
//clarify requirements
//	in BDD write failing features  then pass it by implement the code for mapping the features 
// features of BDD:
	//1- shifting from thinking in tests to thinking in behavoir
	//2- sharing in business and stakeholder and developer 
	//3- ubiquitous language
	//4- driven by business value
	//5- non technical stakeholders can understands
	//6- cucumber - jbehave for java this is bridge between business & technical language
	//7- BDD is not replace of functional testing
//BDD tools : RSpec for ruby - cucumber for java - specflow for .net ( plugin VSC)
// cucumber is testing framework which support BDD 
// define app behavior 	using simple grammar defined by language called gherkin
// cucumber is written in ruby	
// key benefits of BDD:
	//1- all development work can focus on business objectives
	//2- software development meet user needs
	//3- efficient prioritization - business - critical are delivered first
	//4- all team understand the project
	//5- software design matches business needs
	//6-reducing cost of maintenance 
// BDD framework : feature file - steps definition code - run
// Gherkin is a structured language  - team need common language
// used as project documentation
	//Feature: search feature for users
	// can have more scenarios...
	//scenario : when a user searches ....
	//Given user on main page
	//When user searches for books .. And .....
	// Then search page updated with list of books
	//BDD is working with any type of App (web - mobile)
	// install cucumber plugin
